BatteryMat (BMAT) is a framework for analyzing, predicting, and comparing electrochemical properties of battery electrode materials. It integrates JARVIS, ALIGNN, and custom workflows to compute maximum voltage, average voltage, gravimetric capacity, and volumetric capacity across a wide range of cation systems. BMAT also extracts structures, generates POSCAR files, and provides tools for batch computation, plotting, dataset filtering, and result summarization. The project is designed to support high-throughput screening, visualization, and benchmarking of battery materials using lightweight machine-learning surrogates.

In addition to forward prediction, an inverse-design module is in the works that will allow users to search for or propose structures based on voltage and capacity targets. These routines will be combined with AtomGPT to support reasoning-guided structure generation and closed-loop exploration of chemical space. Overall, BMAT provides a compact but flexible toolkit for accelerating battery-materials research through data-driven analysis and fast ML-based property evaluation.
